  abstract = {Many of the popular building energy simulation programs around the world are reaching maturity \textemdash{} some use simulation methods (and even code) that originated in the 1960s. For more than two decades, the US government supported development of two hourly building energy simulation programs, BLAST and DOE-2. Designed in the days of mainframe computers, expanding their capabilities further has become difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. At the same time, the 30 years have seen significant advances in analysis and computational methods and power \textemdash{} providing an opportunity for significant improvement in these tools. In 1996, a US federal agency began developing a new building energy simulation tool, EnergyPlus, building on development experience with two existing programs: DOE-2 and BLAST. EnergyPlus includes a number of innovative simulation features \textemdash{} such as variable time steps, user-configurable modular systems that are integrated with a heat and mass balance-based zone simulation \textemdash{} and input and output data structures tailored to facilitate third party module and interface development. Other planned simulation capabilities include multizone airflow, and electric power and solar thermal and photovoltaic simulation. Beta testing of EnergyPlus began in late 1999 and the first release is scheduled for early 2001.},

  abstract = {Building energy simulation (BES) has been widely adopted for the investigation of building environmental and energy performance for different design and retrofit alternatives. Data-driven analytics is vital for interpreting and analyzing BES results to reveal trends and provide useful insights. However, seamless integration between BES and data-driven analytics current does not exist. This paper presents eplusr, an R package for conducting data-driven analytics with EnergyPlus. The R package is cross-platform and distributed using CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network). With a data-centric design philosophy, the proposed framework focuses on better and more seamless integration between BES and datadriven analytics. It provides structured inputs/outputs format that can be easily piped into data analytics workflows. The R package also provides an infrastructure to bring portable and reusable computational environment for building energy modeling to facilitate reproducibility research.},
